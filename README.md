# Flash Chat

A privacy-focused, serverless chat application with end-to-end encryption that stores messages locally and enables secure sharing via URL. Built with modern web technologies for maximum privacy, security, and user experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages encrypted client-side using ephemeral ECDH key exchange
- **Local Storage**: All messages stored in browser localStorage with no server dependencies
- **URL Sharing**: Generate secure shareable links containing encrypted conversation history
- **Dual Interface**: Switch between Signal-style bubbles and IRC-style linear chat
- **Modern UI**: Glass morphism design with smooth transitions and accessibility features
- **PWA Ready**: Installable as a Progressive Web App with offline capabilities

### Privacy & Security
- **No Server Dependencies**: Works completely offline after initial page load
- **Ephemeral Key Exchange**: Each conversation uses unique encryption keys
- **Client-side Only**: Messages never leave your device unless explicitly shared
- **No Registration**: Automatic anonymous user ID generation
- **Forward Secrecy**: Keys are not persisted beyond the session
- **Data Control**: Full control over your data with secure destruction

### User Experience
- **Theme Support**: Dark and light mode with system preference detection
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with proper focus management
- **Read Receipts**: Visual indicators for message delivery and read status
- **Native Sharing**: Integration with Web Share API for seamless sharing

## Installation

### Development Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:1312` to access the application.

### Production Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
Serve the `dist` directory with any static file server.

### Direct Deployment
The application can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) by building and serving the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### Starting a Conversation
1. Type your message in the input field and press Enter or click Send
2. The first message establishes encrypted communication with automatic key generation
3. Share the conversation URL to invite others to join securely

### Sharing Conversations
1. **Native Sharing**: Click the Share button to use your device's native sharing
2. **Copy Link**: Click the URL in the status bar to copy to clipboard
3. **Secure URLs**: All shared URLs contain encrypted message history

### Interface Modes
- **Signal Mode**: Modern bubble interface with user-specific styling and read receipts
- **IRC Mode**: Traditional linear chat with timestamps and usernames

### Security Features
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Each conversation generates unique encryption keys
- **Forward Secrecy**: Keys are not stored persistently
- **Encrypted Storage**: Messages encrypted before localStorage storage
- **Secure Sharing**: URLs contain encrypted data, not plaintext

## Technical Architecture

### Encryption Implementation
The application uses the Web Crypto API for client-side encryption:
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH P-256 curve for secure key agreement
- **Message Encryption**: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Initialization Vectors**: Random IV for each encrypted message
- **Key Derivation**: Shared secret derived from ephemeral key pairs

### Data Storage Schema
```javascript
// Messages with encryption
{
  "msg_[timestamp]": {
    "text": "Plaintext message",
    "encrypted": true,
    "data": [encrypted_bytes],
    "iv": [initialization_vector],
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "userId": "user_abc123",
    "conversationId": "conv_def456",
    "readBy": ["user_xyz789"],
    "deliveredTo": ["user_xyz789"]
  }
}

// User preferences
{
  "flash_prefs": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "mode": "signal"
  },
  "flash_user_id": "user_abc123",
  "flash_conversation_id": "conv_def456",
  "flash_public_key": [public_key_bytes]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Encryption Protocol
1. **Key Generation**: Each participant generates an ECDH P-256 key pair
2. **Key Exchange**: Public keys exchanged via first message
3. **Shared Secret**: ECDH derives shared AES-GCM key
4. **Message Encryption**: All messages encrypted with derived key
5. **Forward Secrecy**: Keys discarded after session

### Privacy Protection
- **No Telemetry**: No analytics, tracking, or external requests
- **Local Processing**: All encryption/decryption happens locally
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data cleared after use
- **URL Security**: Encrypted payloads in shared URLs

### Threat Model
- **Protects Against**: Network eavesdropping, server breaches, casual snooping
- **Limitations**: URLs contain encrypted data, endpoint security depends on user
- **Recommendations**: Use HTTPS, verify recipient identity, avoid public sharing

## Browser Compatibility

### Required APIs
- Web Crypto API (AES-GCM, ECDH)
- localStorage
- ES2020 JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Service Workers (for PWA features)

### Tested Browsers
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Characteristics

### Load Time
- **Initial Load**: < 50KB compressed
- **Offline Ready**: Service worker caching
- **No Dependencies**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation

### Memory Usage
- **Efficient Storage**: Compressed message history
- **Key Management**: Ephemeral keys for minimal memory footprint
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of encryption contexts

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build with optimization
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
